- **`multiverse_4_inferential-specification-plot.Rmd`**  
  Produces inferential specification plots to visualize variability in the results across analytical choices.

- **`multiverse_4_inferential-specification-plot_cre_avg.Rmd`**  
  Generates additional inferential plots focusing on conditional response effect averages.

- **`multiverse_5_GOSH-plot.Rmd`**  
  Creates a GOSH (Graphical Overview for Study Heterogeneity) plot to investigate the robustness of findings.

- **`multiverse_6_results.Rmd`**
